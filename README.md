### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Software Developer** with a unique background. After a successful career in sales and finance, I transitioned to engineering full-time. My journey began as a pure hobbyist. I started by building tools for gaming communities that grew to now over **50,000 active users**.

A pivotal moment occurred when **Nathan Adams (Principal Engineer of Mojang Studios/Minecraft)** contributed code to one of my repositories. When we briefly spoke, he was surprised that I didn't work in software field professionally. He kindly suggested that I should consider it. So I did, and since then, I have formalized my skills with a B.S. in Software Development.

My primary focus is **Full-Stack Web Development** using various front ends, and backends together, including React, Angular, SQL and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL/MongoDB). I have built ASP.NET Core projects in C#, Java and Spring Boot, and of course many Single-Page Applications in popular Javascript and Typescript stacks (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Express, React, Angular, NodeJS, Vite, and so on). Or, just building intelligently without a framework, in raw JS/HTML/CSS. I can learn and build in any framework given to me. There has never been a challenge given to me that I could not quickly adapt to and solve. I am an obsessive always learner.
