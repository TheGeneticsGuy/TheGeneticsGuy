**About me**

I was once only a self-taught programmer, as long time hobbyist computer anything guy. That hobby has morphed into something more. I have now become a full-time degree-pursuing software developer with years of experience building programs. I have over 50,000 active users that rely on [my most popular project]([m](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guild-roster-manager)). Despite growing up in the professional sales world for my career, I have been coding as a hobby for at least a decade now. Funny enough, it wasn't until [Nathan Adams (aka Dinnerbone)](https://github.com/Dinnerbone) of Minecraft fame submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/TheGeneticsGuy/Guild-Roster-Manager/pull/33/commits/ddebf91ba7ae216bb0a18cfb6f81c0a789523a67) to one of my own projects that got me thinking to myself,  "Why am I not doing this professionally?" So, I decided to persue a Bachelor's Degree in the world of software development where I anticipate graduating in 2025. 

I am skilled in Java, C#, Python, SQL, Lua, and more. I even once contributed code in Perl to a comparison genomics project at the University of Arizona. I work well in collaborative environments, and also on my own. One of the great joys I find in programming is learning, growing, and solving the problems. I like bringing both technical expertise and strong communication skills to the table.

Most importantly, the code I put out here is often a reflection of me building something that I wanted for myself first, and then I thought to myself, "I bet others might find this useful too!"
